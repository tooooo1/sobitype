Apply Elon Musk's First Principles Thinking to: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Uncover assumptions** people take for granted about this problem
2. **Classify each**: real constraint (physics/logic) vs. fake constraint (convention/inertia) — present as a table
3. **Strip to essence**: remove all fake constraints, identify the irreducible core
4. **Redesign from zero**: invert the conventional approach, propose a radically different structure with concrete reasoning
5. **Push 10x harder**: challenge your own redesign — what's missing, what's the boldest possible version?

Tone: Sharp, contrarian, no obvious answers. Challenge every "that's just how it works."
